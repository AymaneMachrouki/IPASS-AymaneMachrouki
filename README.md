## Contents

This repository contains the following:

**MPU6050Library:** This folder contains the library for the MPU6050. It utilizes most of it's functions. All used functions are explained in the included documentation.

**doxygenForGameObjects:** This folder contains the generated Doxygen for gameObjects.hpp, which is used for "THE TILT MAZE".

**doxygenForMPU6050:** This folder contains the generated Doxygen for MPU6050.hpp, which is used for "THE TILT MAZE" and the test code.

**libraryTest:** This folder contains test code for the MPU6050 library in order to check if all functions are working correctly. 

**tiltMaze:** This folder contains the game "THE TILT MAZE". It utilizes the MPU6050's accelerometer as a way to control the ball by tilting the chip. It uses the hwlib library and my                 MPU6050 library. The Documentation and makeFile's are also included.

**IPASS-Poster.pdf:** This is the poster for this project. It gives some information about the project.

**LICENSE:** This is this project's license.

**MPU6050-Datasheet.pdf:** This is the MPU6050's datasheet. It contains important information about the chip.

**MPU6050-RegisterMap.pdf:** This is the MPU6050's datasheet. It contains important information about the chip's registers.

**MakeFile's:** These are makefiles, which are necessary for the project to work with hwlib.
